Endpoints
GET /movies: Get a list of all movies.

GET /movies/genre/:name: Get movies by genre.

GET /movies/:movieId: Get detailed information about a movie.

POST /movies: Add a new movie (requires authentication).

DELETE /movies/:movieId: Delete a movie (requires authentication).

... (similar endpoints for genres, directors, and users)


Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Register a new user using POST /users with a unique username and password.
Log in with POST /login to receive an authentication token.
Use the received token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

Project Description

My Movie API is a web application designed to provide users with access to a diverse collection of movies, directors, genres, and user account functionalities. As a team, we aimed to create an intuitive and feature-rich platform that allows users to explore, rate, and interact with movies while ensuring their data remains secure.

My Role and Completed Tasks

In this project, my role was primarily focused on backend development, including designing and implementing API endpoints, setting up authentication using JWT, and integrating MongoDB to manage data. Some specific tasks I completed include:

API Development: I was responsible for designing and implementing various API endpoints, such as retrieving movie details, adding new movies, and managing user accounts.

Authentication: I integrated JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and securely access their accounts.

Database Management: I utilized MongoDB and Mongoose to manage data related to movies, genres, directors, and user accounts efficiently.

Deployment: I contributed to the deployment process, ensuring that the application runs smoothly on Heroku.

Decisions and Consequences

Several key decisions were made during the development of My Movie API:

Technology Stack: We opted for Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MongoDB as our database, and JWT for authentication due to their scalability, performance, and developer-friendly features.

RESTful API Design: We followed RESTful principles to design our API, making it intuitive and easy to understand for both developers and users.

Security: The decision to use JWT for authentication added an extra layer of security to protect user accounts and sensitive data.

Deployment on Heroku: We chose Heroku as our deployment platform because of its simplicity and seamless integration with our Node.js application.

The consequences of these decisions were largely positive. Our application was able to handle user registrations, logins, and data management effectively. The RESTful API design made it easy for frontend developers to integrate our API into the user interface.

Areas for Improvement

If I could make improvements or do things differently, I would consider the following:

Error Handling: Enhance error handling and validation to provide more informative feedback to users and frontend developers.

Testing: Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing to ensure robustness and reliability.

Scalability: Design the application architecture with scalability in mind to handle a larger user base and a growing movie collection.

Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I learned valuable lessons:

The importance of planning and designing API endpoints thoroughly to ensure a smooth development process.

How to secure an API using JWT for authentication and authorization.

The significance of effective communication within a development team to coordinate tasks and resolve issues efficiently.

The need for continuous improvement and adaptability, as software development is an iterative process.

In conclusion, My Movie API was a rewarding project that allowed us to apply our skills in backend development, database management, and authentication. It also provided insights into teamwork, project planning, and the significance of creating a user-friendly and secure application.
